Sorry about the bony elbows, sorry we lived here, sorry about the scene at the bottom of the stairwell and how I ruined everything by saying it out loud. Especially that, but I should have known. You see, I take the parts that I remember and stitch them back together to make a creature that will do what I say or love me back." />

I&#39;ll be your slaughterhouse, your killing floor, your morgue and final resting, walking around with this bullet inside me &#39;cause I couldn&#39;t make you love me and I’m tired of pulling your teeth. " />

Inside your head the sound of glass, a car crash sound as the trucks roll over and explode in slow motion. Hello darling, sorry about that." />
